    <p>                             The pygames hackathon runs from March 20th, 2023 to April 17th 2023, and is open to people in USA and Canada. 
        
        For this one there's $12,700 in prizes. "If you love programming and gaming, this is the perfect opportunity to showcase your skills and have some fun!"

Then the must-use-python PyWeek challenge "Invites entrants to write a game in one week from scratch either as an individual or in a team. Is intended to be challenging and fun.

Will hopefully increase the public body of python game tools, code and expertise. Will let a lot of people actually finish a game, and may inspire new projects (with ready made teams!).

" PyWeek runs from March 26nd, 2023 to April 2nd 2023, and theme voting is already on.

Finally, Ludum Dare is an event where you create a game from scratch in a weekend based on a theme. April 28th, 2023. Starts at 3:00 AM CEST *. Ludumdare is the oldest online game jam, and has the largest number of participants.

There is a Jam (72h, less restrictive rules), and a compo (48h more rules). The Jam now lets people submit paper board games, and even things like crafts that aren't games at all!

        Pygame requires Python; if you don't already have it, you can download it from python.org. It's recommended to run the latest python version, because it's usually faster and has better features than the older ones. Bear in mind that pygame has dropped support for python 2.

The best way to install pygame is with the pip tool (which is what python uses to install packages). Note, this comes with python in recent versions. We use the --user flag to tell it to install into the home directory, rather than globally.
